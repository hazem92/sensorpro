Here you can find three algorithms to run your HH10D Humidity Sensor.
The goal of these algorithms is to measure the frequency of the square
signal generated by the sensor (you can find further information in docs).

The first one is using the library Freqcounter (based on Timers, 
you can not use this library on any arduino pin)

The second one is using the basic arduino function pulseIn (thanks to the
shape of the signal we can use this function)

The third one is using Interruptions (keep in mind that for example 
in an arduino nano board if you want to use Interruptions on the D2 pin 
you have to use its real interruption number (INT0) in the function
" attachInterrupt() " not its pin number.

After finding the signal frequency, we have this formula to measure the humidity :
" (Offset-Frequency)*sensitivity/4096 "
To find out these two constants you have to use i2c bus to read them from EEPROM 
on the sensor (fu=or further informations please go to the docs file).

I tested the three algorihms and I prefer to use FreqCounter and Interruption.
